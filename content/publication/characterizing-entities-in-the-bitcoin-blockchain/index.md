abstract: Bitcoin has created a new exchange paradigm within which financial
  transactions can be trusted without an intermediary. This premise of a free
  decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current
  implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction
  verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous
  context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network
  information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern
  of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By
  definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not
  directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information
  about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to
  entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in
  practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge
  is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.
