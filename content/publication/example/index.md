abstract: Combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback generalize multi-armed
  bandits, where the agent chooses sets of arms and observes a noisy reward for
  each arm contained in the chosen set. The action set satisfies a given
  structure such as forming a base of a matroid or a path in a graph. We focus
  on the pure-exploration problem of identifying the best arm with fixed
  confidence, as well as a more general setting, where the structure of the
  answer set differs from the one of the action set. Using the recently
  popularized game framework, we interpret this problem as a sequential zero-sum
  game and develop a CombGame meta-algorithm whose instances are asymptotically
  optimal algorithms with finite time guarantees. In addition to comparing two
  families of learners to instantiate our meta-algorithm, the main contribution
  of our work is a specific oracle efficient instance for best-arm
  identification with combinatorial actions. Based on a projection-free online
  learning algorithm for convex polytopes, it is the first computationally
  efficient algorithm which is asymptotically optimal and has competitive
  empirical performance.
