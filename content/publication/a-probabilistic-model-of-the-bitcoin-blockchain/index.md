abstract: The Bitcoin transaction graph is a public data structure organized as
  transactions between addresses, each associated with a logical entity. In this
  work, we introduce a complete probabilistic model of the Bitcoin Blockchain,
  setting the basis for follow-up AI applications on Bitcoin transactions. We
  first formulate a set of conditional dependencies induced by the Bitcoin
  protocol at the block level and derive a corresponding fully observed
  graphical model of a Bitcoin block. We then extend the model to include hidden
  entity attributes such as the functional category of the associated logical
  agent and derive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this
  model. At the network level, we show evidence of complex
  transaction-to-transaction behavior and present a relevant discriminative
  model of the agent categories. Performance of both the block-based graphical
  model and the network-level discriminative model are evaluated on a subset of
  the public Bitcoin Blockchain.
