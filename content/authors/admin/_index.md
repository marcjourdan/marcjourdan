I am a first-year PhD student at CRIStAL (CNRS) in the Inria Scool team (formerly SequeL), under the supervision of [Emilie Kaufmann](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/). Prior to my PhD, I graduated from ETH Zurich and École Polytechnique.

My main research interest is Multi-Armed Bandits, with a particular focus on identification problems. I also explore the theoretical understanding of these algorithms when only few samples are available.

My research interests also include reinforcement learning, online learning, Bayesian optimization, statistics and machine learning in general. I focus on developing theoretically well-founded and practically applicable algorithms.
