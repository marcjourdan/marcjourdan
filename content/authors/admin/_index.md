I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Theory of Machine Learning](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tml/) lab at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/), working with [Nicolas Flammarion](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.flammarion) to deepen the theoretical understanding of Large Language Models and their advanced learning capabilities. My research interests include multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, online learning, imitation learning, optimization, statistics, and machine learning in general. I focus on developing theoretically well-founded and practically applicable algorithms.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/), where I worked under the direction of [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/) in the Inria [Scool](https://team.inria.fr/scool/) team. My PhD research focused on pure exploration problems for stochastic multi-armed bandits. My thesis endeavored to establish the Top Two approach as a principled methodology offering nearly optimal theoretical guarantees alongside state-of-the-art empirical performance. My thesis touched upon various aspects of bandit theory: parametric and non-parametric classes of distributions, structural assumptions on their means, and different identification problems. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to visit [Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/) at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en) in the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Learning Algorithms](https://sites.google.com/view/lailaunimi) for three months, where I worked on adversarial regret minimization for contextual linear bandits.

Before my PhD, I graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/). I conducted my Master's thesis in the [Learning & Adaptive Systems](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/) group of [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea), where I studied pure exploration for combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback.
