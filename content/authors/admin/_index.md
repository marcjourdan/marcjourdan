I am a first-year PhD student at CRIStAL (CNRS) in the Inria Scool team (formerly SequeL), under the supervision of [Emilie Kaufmann](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/). Prior to my PhD, I graduated from ETH Zurich and École Polytechnique.

My main research interest is Multi-Armed Bandits, with a particular focus on identification problems. I also explore the theoretical understanding of these algorithms when only few samples are available.
